Abstract
Once viewed as a luxury good, nowadays wine is increasingly enjoyed by a wider range of consumers. In order to support market growth, the wine industry is investing in new technologies for both wine making and selling processes. Wine quality assessment is the key element within this context. Physicochemical laboratory tests routinely used to characterize wine include determination of density, alcohol or pH values, while sensory tests rely mainly on human experts. In this report, we will propose a data mining approach to predict human wine taste preferences that is based on easily available analytical tests.
 
Question/Hypotheses:
 What kinds of red wine tend to have higher quality? Does higher quality red wine tend to have a higher alcohol?
